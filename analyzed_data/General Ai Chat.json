This approach allows the model to capture a range of spatial and temporal scales, and to learn both local and global patterns in the data.

The model is part of a family of Llama models, including upgraded 70 billion and 8 billion parameter models, which are multilingual and have a significantly longer context length of 128K, state-of-the-art tool use, and overall stronger reasoning capabilities[1][3].

It's just a simple and fun tool to experiment with.  TableGPT, generate any table with any content of your choosing. (Results may vary) - Enter your Groq api key and start generating tables with content.  - It is also lighting fast with the fast inference from Groq.  - Add, remove or change columns and rows with just your voice or chat. - You can also add your own tables, but that is still a little buggy.  - All your data is gone as soon as your refresh.  I created this in like 30 minutes, so it might be a little buggy. and the Groq api gives you a mass amount of credits to play around with, so just spam to your hearts desire.

Knitting - Knitting was a common way to produce clothing and textiles, especially before the industrial revolution. Woodworking - Carpentry and woodworking were essential trades for creating furniture, tools, and buildings. Blacksmithing - Once a critical job for making tools, horseshoes, and weapons, blacksmithing is now often pursued as a hobby. Weaving - Weaving was a common profession for producing fabric for clothing, rugs, and other textiles. Brewing - Brewing beer and other beverages was once a small-scale job, often done at home or in small communities. Gardening - While still a profession in agriculture, gardening was once a primary way for families to grow their own food. Calligraphy - Before the printing press, calligraphy was a respected profession for creating books and important documents. Quilting - Quilting was historically a practical way to make warm bedding, now often enjoyed as a creative craft. Leatherworking - Crafting leather goods, such as shoes, bags, and belts, was once a common trade. Tailoring/Sewing - Tailoring and sewing were essential skills for making and mending clothing before mass production. Candle Making - Candles were once a primary source of light, and candle making was an essential trade. Herbalism - Herbalists used to play a crucial role in healthcare, preparing medicines from plants, a practice still enjoyed by many as a hobby. Fishing - Once a primary way to provide food, fishing is now also a popular recreational activity. Metalworking - Metalworkers were vital for making everything from cutlery to tools; now, metalworking is often a hobby for creating art or custom pieces. These activities have transitioned from essential trades to hobbies for many, often driven by advances in technology and changes in society's needs.\n[14/08/2024, 10:22:54] +91\u00a06380\u00a0506\u00a0700: Your security code with +91\u00a06380\u00a0506\u00a0700 changed."]}, {"date": "2024-08-13", "sentiment": 0.7, "messages": ["CNN\n\u2014  Even as tech giants pour billions of dollars into what they herald as humanity\u2019s new frontier, a recent study shows that tacking the \u201cAI\u201d label on products may actually drive people away.", "https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/10/business/brands-avoid-term-customers/index.html"]}, {"date": "2024-08-14", "sentiment": 0.2, "messages": ["\"Ai Experts\" will tell you need a complex multi-agent framework to build agentic systems.

But on the other hand, they bring unprecedented risks, from ecological destruction to the misuse of AI and genetic manipulation. At this threshold, your future depends on how you choose to navigate the ethical and philosophical challenges that arise. Humanity has often been reactive to the consequences of its actions, but your survival will require a shift toward foresight, collaboration, and responsibility on a global scale. In essence, your ability to thrive is as much about nurturing a moral and ethical maturity as it is about scientific advancement. The path forward isn\u2019t just about technological mastery but ensuring those technologies serve the collective good and don\u2019t fragment societies or harm the planet beyond repair. It is a delicate dance, but one that could lead to an enlightened future if humanity masters the steps."]}, {"date": "2024-10-17", "sentiment": -0.3, "messages": ["80% will likely be gone in 9 to 12 months", "I haven't seen many tutorials on deepseek\n[17/10/2024, 7:49:59] +91\u00a075012\u00a055608: Your security code with +91\u00a075012\u00a055608 changed.\n[17/10/2024, 10:02:38] +91\u00a075012\u00a055608: Your security code with +91\u00a075012\u00a055608 changed.", "Some cool new features coming - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IACBZDjVW3k\n[17/10/2024, 10:28:17] +91\u00a075012\u00a055608: Your security code with +91\u00a075012\u00a055608 changed."]}, {"date": "2024-10-17", "sentiment": -0.3, "messages": ["80% will likely be gone in 9 to 12 months", "I haven't seen many tutorials on deepseek\n[17/10/2024, 7:49:59] +91\u00a075012\u00a055608: Your security code with +91\u00a075012\u00a055608 changed.\n[17/10/2024, 10:02:38] +91\u00a075012\u00a055608: Your security code with +91\u00a075012\u00a055608 changed."]}, {"date": "2024-10-18", "sentiment": 0.6, "messages": ["https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet\n[18/10/2024, 5:09:24] +91\u00a075012\u00a055608: Your security code with +91\u00a075012\u00a055608 changed.", "Fast and losses inferencing framework of 1-bit LLMs BitNet b1.58 on CPU.
