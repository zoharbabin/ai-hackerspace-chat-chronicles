I'm also wondering if anyone would like to help me out with a challenge I'm currently facing on one of my projects. Just to be clear, I'm not looking for investors right now. I'm hoping to connect with individuals who are interested in starting a film production agency focused on cinematography and other aspects of film production. My big idea is to eventually create a movie-making app that leverages AI to help writers like me produce high-quality visuals for our stories. I think we could start with an experiment or a demo and then grow it into a practical, commercial solution. And who knows, maybe we could even make it open-source so other writers or novelists could use it to adapt their own stories into films. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brunosimonet_ai-is-the-sixth-great-revolution-in-007745213597925378-p4eS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android"]}, {"date": "2024-06-16", "sentiment": 0.5, "messages": ["Totally agree.
