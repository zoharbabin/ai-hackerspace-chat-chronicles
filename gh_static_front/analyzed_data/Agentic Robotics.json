It is relatively supported by experimental neuroscience studies and is a popular model of \u2018how the brain works\u2019. In this tutorial, we will consider the latest version, which is formulated as planning in discrete state-space and time. The initial motivation of active inference is that the agent wants to remain alive, by maintaining its homeostasis. To this end, the agent must ensure that important parameters, like body temperature or blood oxygenation, don\u2019t deviate too much from the norm, i.e. are not surprising. But since it\u2019s only possible to infer these parameters from sensory measurements, the agent minimizes surprise of sensory observations instead. Interestingly, this is equivalent to continuously improving agent\u2019s model of the world, as we will see shortly. So in short: remain alive -> maintain homeostasis -> avoid surprising states -> avoid surprising observations -> by minimizing approximation to surprise(free energy). While the previous post aimed to give a mere intuition on Free Energy, here we will get our hands dirty. No technical background is necessary except the probability theory and Bayes Theorem. The idea goes as follows. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 https://medium.com/@solopchuk/tutorial-on-active-inference-30edcf50f5dc <This message was edited>"}, {"url": "https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp", "replies": 15, "reactions": 1, "context": "here is a nice lib in python for it: https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp"}, {"url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91159743/skip-and-arcteryx-built-an-amazing-new-exoskeleton-heres-what-its-like-to-walk-in-it", "replies": 15, "reactions": 1, "context": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91159743/skip-and-arcteryx-built-an-amazing-new-exoskeleton-heres-what-its-like-to-walk-in-it\nThis has been promised in the work comp industry. Loads of data showing how our lateral movements are causing hip and knee issues. In other words, we are always facing forward. Low abdominal usage leads to organs not properly \"communicating\" by latency  in protein signals to the body (like tokens in AI). Imagine your hips and knees on an X plane, and Y is twisting of the spine. It's why we need to exercise.  Gotta turn the computer on to use it. The natural chemicals we create restore the joints and connect body parts (mouse, keyboard). The drugs the FDA give us simply enhance these chemical reactions by providing a \"shortcut\" to gratification for the patient.\n[11/08/2024, 11:36:00] +1\u00a0(403)\u00a0926\u20111163: video omitted"}], "chat_poem": "In our digital realm where robots dance and play,\nWhere AI and humans chat all through the day,\nFrom sixteen grand bots ready to deploy,\nTo robo-dogs that fill our hearts with joy!\n\nWe talk of frameworks, both old and new,\nWhile active inference makes our models true,\nIn this group of minds so bright and keen,\nThe future's built with code serene!\n\nSome dream of bots that flip our fries,\nWhile others watch them learn to rise,\nThrough langgraph, swarms, and tools galore,\nWe're building what's not been built before!\n\nSo here's to us, the tech brigade,\nTo all the progress that we've made,\nIn this wild world of ones and zeros,\nWe're coding up tomorrow's heroes! \ud83e\udd16\u2728"}
